        <h2>Tennis</h2>
        <p>Tennis is played between two players (singles) or two teams of two (doubles) on a rectangular court divided by a net. The objective is to hit the ball over the net into the opponentâ€™s court in a way they cannot return it. Points are scored in increments of 15 (15, 30, 40, game). A match is played over a series of sets. A set is usually played to six games, and a match is typically best of three or five sets. The game starts with a serve, and players take turns returning the ball. A point is scored if the opponent fails to return the ball properly. The ball must land within the designated lines, and faults occur if a player misses the serve, hits the ball out, or fails to return it before it bounces twice.</p>
